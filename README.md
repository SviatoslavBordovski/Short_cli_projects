<h3>2. Bill payment with counted overtime hours</h3>
<p>Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay.
<p>Pay the hourly rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours.
<p>Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75).
<p>You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number.
<p>Do not worry about error checking the user input - assume the user types numbers properly.
<p><b>Program can handle the errors in the terminal caused by user when he/she enters words instead of the numbers.</b></p>

<h3>3. Based on a user's order, work out their final pizza bill.</h3>
<p>Small Pizza: $15</p>
<p>Medium Pizza: $20</p>
<p>Large Pizza: $25</p>
<p>Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2</p>
<p>Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3</p>
<p>Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1</p>

<h3>4. <b>program</b> that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters <i>done</i>.</h3>

<h5>Program workflow is:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Once 'done' is entered in the terminal, python is printing out the largest and smallest of the numbers</li>
  <li>When user enters anything other than a valid number, python program will catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number</li>
  <li>Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals:</h3> 
<br>
<p>:heavy_check_mark: Remember all the values user enters the number it is remembered by the program.</p>
<p>:heavy_check_mark: Figure out and record to memory the <b>maximum</b> and <b>minimum</b> numbers.</p>
<p>:heavy_check_mark: Error validation for anything that is not a number entered by the user.</p>
<br>
<p>There is no GUI for this program, so it could be runned in the <b>terminal</b> only.</p>
