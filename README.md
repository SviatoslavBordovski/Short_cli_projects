<h1>Bill-payment-with-overtime-hours</h1>

<p>Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay.</p>
<br>
<p>Pay the hourly rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours.</p>
<br>
<p>Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75).</p>
<br>
<p>You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number.</p>
<br>
<p>Do not worry about error checking the user input - assume the user types numbers properly.</p>
<br>
<b>Program can handle the errors in the terminal caused by user when he/she enters words instead of the numbers.</b>
