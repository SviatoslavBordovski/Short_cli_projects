<h3>1. Bill payment with counted overtime hours</h3>
<br>

<p>Pay the hourly rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours.
<p>Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75).
<p>You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number.
<p>Do not worry about error checking the user input - assume the user types numbers properly.
<p><b>Program can handle the errors in the terminal caused by user when he/she enters words instead of the numbers.</b></p>
