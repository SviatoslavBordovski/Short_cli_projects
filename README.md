# Bill-payment-with-overtime-hours

Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay.
<br>
Pay the hourly rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours.
<br>
Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). 
<br>
You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number.
<br>
Do not worry about error checking the user input - assume the user types numbers properly.
<br>
<b>Program can hadle the errors in tthe terminal caused by user when he/she enters words instead of the numbers.</b>
